Just going through the lectures to make the concepts clear

After we do git add for the first time and check the git status its doesnt show anything but after that once we update the file in here (visual studio), when we do git status it gonna show two things.      1. changes to be committed 2. changes not staged for commit.

NOTE: once we update the file we need to do git add again in order to to update the file at stagging level once.
